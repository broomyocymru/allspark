# Custom Sparks
Sparks are simply the glue to creating combinations of infrastructure and provisioning code into a re-usable configuration. Both the terraform and ansible modules should be usable independently. A good example of this is the VM module, this is used with many sparks as the core machine setup is the same, only the software provisioning stage differs.

## Infrastructure
Re-use or Create a new Terraform Module

## Software
Re-Use or Create a new Ansible Galaxy Role

## Configure AllSpark
Add configuration settings to AllSpark
