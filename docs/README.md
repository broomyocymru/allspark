# AllSpark

A cloud agnostic toolchain built combining Terraform and Ansible with a Python CLI. Its objective is to become an accelerator to migrate enterprise estates into the cloud in a secure, scalable and cloud agnostic way using open source technologies and remaining as un-opinionated as possible.


### Architecture
AllSpark is made up of a number of reusable infrastructure components that combine together. They simplify the cloud specific implementation by abstracting the details into cloud specific modules.  


### Sparks
A Spark is a configuration combining architecture component(s) with software provisioning for accelerated implementation.
